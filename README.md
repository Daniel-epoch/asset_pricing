# Asset Pricing Knowledge Basement
## 0. Introduction
I am **JIN Jialin**(金佳林) from **BIT**(Beijing Institude of Technology) in China.

THIS repository is bulit with the aim of improving command of asset pricing and quantity investment myself. I would push the code I write according to my understanding and share with people who enjoy the same field as I do.

Because of my ignorance, I could not make this repository as perfect as possible. So any advice is welcomed! (...no judge if u could)
